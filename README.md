# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Preiction

## Overview
 It is observed that in many businesses only a small percentage of the customers generate high revenue. It is known as the 80-20 rule, also called Pareto Principle, is an
aphorism which implies 80% of the revenue is generated by just 20% of the customers. Therefore, it becomes very important for a company to target those customers maybe by showing some ads or by giving them any offers, to get higher profits. Given a customerâ€™s previous transactions done, we need to predict the revenue generated by them in the near future, so that the marketing team can invest appropriately on promotional strategies. In simple words we need to find out the potential customer and the revenue they would generate in the near future.
